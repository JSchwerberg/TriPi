**Changes in this release**

-Update 12/05/2015

-This update brings TriPi to version 4.2

-Updated Splashscreen

-Added new menu entry to the main Emulationstation screen called "TriPi". This new menu will house all the TriPi management options such as the updater script, the Wireless controller hotfix script, and any future options I decide to add.

-The Kodi and Minecraft ports are still housed in the "Ports" menu.



-If you already have a TriPi-based setup (RetroPie + Kodi 15.1 installed on top of Raspbian Wheezy), or used previous versions of TriPi that were on my github, you can clone this repo and run update.sh (as sudo, of course). From then on, you will have a "TriPi-Updater" option under "Ports" in ES.

-You may run this updater anyways if you modified TriPi-related files and want to attempt to restore them.

-If you modified files unrelated to TriPi, this will not fix them and you will probably need to find answers elsewhere.

Check back later for future releases.
