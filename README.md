**Changes in this release**

-Update 11/14/2015

-This update brings TriPi to version 4.1

-Updated Splashscreen

-Minecraft-Pi is now supported! Your Xbox360 controller should now be compatible with your Minecraft-Pi install that is provided by the RetroPie Devs! If you don't already have it, grab it from the 'experimental packages' section of RetroPie setup!

-Controls are as follows (NOTE THAT WIRELESS CONTROLLERS HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED YET!!!): 
Right Trigger: Smash Block
Left Trigger: Place Block
Right/Left Bumpers: Use to select items assigned in your hotbar
Y Button: Inventory
A button: Jump (double-tap to fly)
B button: Corouch/Decend while in flight
X button: INTENTIONALLY NOT MAPPED. MAY BE USED IN FUTURE BUILDS IF MINECRAFT-PI GETS UPDATED WITH MORE FEATURES
Start: This is your 'enter' key. Use it to make a selection when in inventory or in a menu
Back: This is your 'esc' key. Use it to open the menu or go back.
Left analog stick: Movement
Right analog stick: 'Look' directions/Camera angle adjust. (Use it to look around)
Xbox Guide Button: Press this to quit Minecraft-Pi and return to Emulationstation


-If you already have a TriPi-based setup (RetroPie + Kodi 15.1 installed on top of Raspbian Wheezy), or used previous versions of TriPi that were on my github, you can clone this repo and run update.sh (as sudo, of course). From then on, you will have a "TriPi-Updater" option under "Ports" in ES.

-You may run this updater anyways if you modified TriPi-related files in version 4.0 and want to attempt to restore them.

-If you modified files unrelated to TriPi, this will not fix them and you will probably need to find answers elsewhere.

Check back later for future releases.

**Release type**

Hotfix - Although the hotfix option will show up for everyone who takes this update, you have to actually RUN the hotfix for it to modify anything. If you're like me and want to have the absolute latest and greatest, you can run the TriPi updater so you can grab it. Though if you were not experiencing the above issues, or are not using a wireless controller, DO NOT run the hotfix after updating or you will most likely ruin something.
